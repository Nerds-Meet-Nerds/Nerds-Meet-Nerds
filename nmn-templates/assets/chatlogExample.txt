Each log should be a long single string templated as such:

each message will be this template

{user_id}:'{message}'|

stringing messages together this way:

{user_id}:'{message}'|{user_id}:'{message}'|{user_id}:'{message}'|


exmple:

1:'Hey there cutie! I was thinking that we should hang out!'|3:'Oh hello! Okay I would be interested. What are you interested in?'|1:'I like blowing up stuff! Explosions are really pretty'|3:'Oh... that's interesting'|
